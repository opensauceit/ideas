What needs building/fixing?
========

Ever had an idea for an open-source project that was too ambitious to start on? Or that you don't have time for? Or you're trying to make your first contribution and want some help?

That's where the tasty magic of open sauce comes in. We're a meetup comprised of 100% undiluted, unadulterated open-source coding. No talks. Just open-source coding. Coding your own projects, joint projects, new code, maintaining exisiting projects: the lot.

Add an idea for something to work on as an issue and watch as a generous dollop of open source enthusism makes it real.
