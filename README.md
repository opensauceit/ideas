#Run Nodeschool classes in the browser
* I am somewhat biased as I do love and run Nodeschool, anyhow: Everyone knows how easy it is as a newbie to get stuck setting up the environment. Sometimes things just won't install, or things tend to get confusing causing a sense of hoplessness and results in people giving up! The idea is to create a way to run each exercise in the browser through a webconsole and in-browser editor. Something like runnable/codebox but for Nodeschool initially (as they have a lot of courses available). This could then be used by anyone to create their own online classroom + courses.
