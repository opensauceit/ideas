Open Sauce - the tastiest open-source meetup
========

Ever had an idea for an open-source project that was too ambitious to start on? Or that you don't have time for? Or you're trying to make your first contribution and want some help?

That's where the tasty magic of open sauce comes in. We're a meetup comprised of 100% undiluted, unadulterated open-source coding. No talks. Just open-source coding. Coding your own projects, joint projects, new code, maintaining existing projects: the lot.

[Add](https://github.com/opensauceit/ideas/issues) an idea for something to work on as an issue and watch as a generous dollop of open source enthusiasm makes it real.
